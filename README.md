# Rainmaker Intern Project

## setup

1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
2. Start: `yarn dev`

### Overview:

This repository is a bare bones Next.js + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript project for calculating slippage on a DEX trade. It's intended to exercise and evaluate usage of ethers, TypeScript, Ethereum contracts, and related components.

### Objective:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Update `quote.ts` and follow along with the comments to implement a swap/slippage estimator.
3. Output results on main page
4. Commit your changes and share the results with us.

### Extension

Create a UI where a user can select "from" and "to" tokens, input the amount they want to trade, and view the output & slippage in the UI.

### Tips:

- As with much of blockchain coding, this project doesn't require much code to accomplish the goal. It's mostly an exercise of reading documentation and understanding how to use the tools available.
- ChatGPT can probably solve most of this project for you, but that kinda defeats the purpose. If you want to use it for inspiration, go nuts, but we intend to ask some followup questions and it'll be important that you know what your code does.
- If you get stuck, don't hesitate to reach out for help! Push your progress and reach out. Let's collaborate.
- We've included the extension so that you can showcase your design prowess or UI skills if you'd like. Please focus on getting the swap/slippage task done first.
